Changelog:
10/12/16:
>Wrote the add table and add attribute functions in crel.c
10/12/15:
>Project now compiles -- content free ATM, but dbmenu now works. This is beneficial to a more agile/extreme method to software development, as the project can be compiled and run as parts begin to work.
10/12/10:
>Added more functions to crel.h
10/12/09:
>Removed cmap.c and cmap.h, and instead replaced them with crel.c and crel.h, the source and header files for the relation structure definitions and handling functions. Parsing will be tackled next.
>Updated README.
10/12/02:
>Killed Subversion repository; removed directories added for the purposes of Subversion. Added src/common and include/common for common library functions and data structures. Also began work on a C-based map data structure (include/common/cmap.h and src/common/cmap.c) which is intended to be used for the SQL parsing engine.
10/11/25:
>Constructed Subversion repository; added directories trunk, tags, and branches; edited README
10/11/09:
>First commit: added the readme (this file) as well as constructed the directory structure.
